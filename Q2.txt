Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects:
   
    Objects,it is the most import  Datatype in javascript and it also play main role in modern JavaScript.
These objects are different from JavaScriptâ€™s primary data-types like Number, String, Boolean,null,
undefined and symbol.These primary data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are complex because of every object contain any combination of primary Datatype.In other words
Objects is reference of Datatypes.Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.These key can
be variables or functions.

Objects and properties:

    ->Every object has some property associated with some value
    ->These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.
        {For example;
                Let us creat object name 'Student' and property name 'Age', 'Class'and 'Grade'
                      var Student=new object();
                      Student.Age=14;
                      Student.Class="8th standard";
                      Student.Grade="O";}
    ->we can access the value by using this syntax [Objectname.propertyname]
            #student.age => (output=14)
    ->Unassigned properties of an object are undefined or null
    ->properties of javascript object can also be set by brackets"[]"
    ->creating an ojbect by literal simply define the property and values inside curly braces.
      example;
            # var person={name:"Hari",age=25,height="172 cm"}

Objects methods:
      ->Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal
      ->Create JavaScript Object with Constructor
      ->By using the JavaScript Keyword new
      ->By using the Object.create method
