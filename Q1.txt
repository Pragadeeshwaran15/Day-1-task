Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer:
HTTP-Hypertext transfer protocol,It is used to communicate information in between request and respose through servers.

 Difference between HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP2:

HTTP/1.1:
 -It works on textual format

 -HTTP1.1 load request one after another,so if any request cannot be loaded,it block other requests.

 -HTTP 1.1 requires it by the specification. The host header is specially important to route messages through proxy servers, allowing to
  distinguish domains that point to the same IP

 -In HTTP1.1 there is an open connection between the server & client and persistent connection which means several 
  requests & responses are merged in a single connection

HTTP/2:
 -It works on the binary protocol

 -In HTTP 2 it use single TCP(Transmission control protocol) connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that 
  no one request blocks any other request.

 -To speed up the web performance both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 comperss messages to make them smaller.
 However,HTTP/2 use more advanced method called HPACK

 -To avoid a server receiving lots of requests, HTTP 2.0 introduced a server push functionality.
  With that, the server tries to predict the resources that will be requested soon. So, the server proactively pushes these
  resources to the client cach.
  
 -HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization. This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time.
